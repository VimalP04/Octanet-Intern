                <p class="question">Where do we use return policy?</p>
                <p class="answer">The return statement can only be used within function bodies. When a return statement is used in a function body, the execution of the function is stopped. The return statement has different effects when placed in different functions: In a plain function, the call to that function evaluates to the return value.</p>
